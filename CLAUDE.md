# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project rules

The full set of project rules — commands, the 100% coverage gate, the `UserScope` ownership invariant, the Controller → Service → Repository layering, error-response handling, the stub-based unit test style, and the translation and generated-asset conventions — lives in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). Read it before changing controllers, repositories, exceptions, or tests. It is the single source of truth for both files; add new rules there rather than duplicating them here.

## Working here

- Start from the smallest relevant test (`php artisan test --compact --filter=test_name`), then run `composer test` once the change is complete.
- Run `composer fix` before proposing a commit: Rector and Pint both fail the gate on unformatted code.
- The coverage minimum is 100%. Ship the test with the code, in the same change.
- Do not stage or commit; the user handles git.
